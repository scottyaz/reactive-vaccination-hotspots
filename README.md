reactive-vaccination-hotspots
=============================
This is the public repository for source code from the manuscript "Reactive Vaccination in the Presence of Disease Hotspots" (in press Proceeedings of Royal Society B). While I have tried to comment relavent portions, it is not perfect and is released in the sprit of "Publish your code, it's good enough". If you have any questions about the code please feel free to conact me at azman@jhu.edu.
